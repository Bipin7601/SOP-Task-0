Chicken


So this tricky question of "which came first:The chicken or the egg" has been a controversy for decades now. All the explanations given for this question has been a contradiction. So I'm not going to bother you by giving any scientific theories.
I told it was Chicken and I'm positive that it is chicken.Don't ask me why.Beacuse you told me it is a question(singular,only one question) and I've answered that.Don't shoot multiple questions on me.So basically just piss people off by telling them this,because everything about this is contradictory.
